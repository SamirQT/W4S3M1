# W4S3M1: In Class Activity


## ðŸ•’ Activity Overview (15â€“20â€¯min)

**Objective:**

1. Observe and reason about mutable vs. immutable objects via `id()`
2. Practice iterating over lists, using `for` loops, `enumerate`, and common list methods


## Part 1: Mutability vs. Immutability (â‰ˆ7â€¯min)

1. **Starter snippet (in `exercise.py`):**

   ```python
   # Part 1: Mutable vs Immutable
   a = 100
   b = a
   print("Before:", a, b, id(a), id(b))

   a += 1
   print("After a += 1:", a, b, id(a), id(b))

   x = [1, 2, 3]
   y = x
   print("Before:", x, y, id(x), id(y))

   x.append(4)
   print("After x.append(4):", x, y, id(x), id(y))
   ```

2. **Tasks:**

   * **Predict**: What will the `id` values tell us for `a` vs. `b`, and for `x` vs. `y`?
   * **Run** the code and **verify** your predictions.
   * **Answer** in comments:

     * Why did `id(a)` change but `id(x)` did not?
     * What does this say about integers vs. lists in Python?

3. **Deliverable:**

   * Add a short comment under each block explaining your observations.

## Part 2: Lists, `for`â€‘loops, `enumerate`, and Methods (â‰ˆ10â€¯min)

1. **Extend `exercise.py` with:**

   ```python
   # Part 2: Lists & Loops
   names = ["alice", "bob", "charlie", "dana"]

   # Task A: Upperâ€‘case each name and store in new list
   upper_names = []
   for n in names:
       # your code here
       pass

   # Task B: Use enumerate to print index + 1 alongside name
   # Expected output:
   # 1. Alice
   # 2. Bob
   # ...
   for idx, name in enumerate(upper_names, start=1):
       # your code here
       pass

   # Task C: Demonstrate at least two list methods (e.g., insert, pop, remove, sort)
   #   1. Insert a new name at position 2
   #   2. Remove "charlie"
   #   3. Sort the list
   # Print the list after each operation.
   ```

2. **Tasks:**

   * **Fill in** Taskâ€¯A to build `upper_names`.
   * **Implement** Taskâ€¯B using `enumerate`.
   * **Choose** and apply two list methods in Taskâ€¯C; print after each.
   * **Discuss**: Whatâ€™s the difference between modifying `names` vs. creating a new list?

3. **Deliverable:**

   * Completed code in `exercise.py` with printed output demonstrating each step.

## Wrapâ€‘Up & Discussion (â‰ˆ3â€¯min)

* **Compare**: What patterns did you notice about mutability?
* **Reflect**: When might you prefer immutability? When is a listâ€™s mutability useful?
* **Share** one new thing you learned with the class.



Discuss your observations with your partner and be ready to share!
